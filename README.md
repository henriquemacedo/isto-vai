## Intro

### This Will (Isto Vai)
Some things just aren’t translatable. We are one of those things. We aren’t exactly an event. Nor are we a podcast or a conference. Debate? Not really. We’re more of a happening. We happen. Only online, when we feel we should, with whichever issue tickles our fancy, with whomever we know can keep up and not scare easily.

The first time we happened, we were called Isto Vai Dar Merda. Loosely translated, it means Shit Is Going To Hit the Fan. It’s an expression, a Portuguese expression used when there’s a warning to be issued. Somebody does something, and somebody else lets out an Isto Vai Dar Merda to warn of the consequences of what that person did. We use the expression a lot. We’re from Portugal.

No other cluster of words could better express what we wanted to communicate when we realised the shit we were in due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Shit wasn’t just going to hit the fan; it was going to destroy it. So, instead of just complaining about the obvious, we rolled our sleeves up and created an online happening about the pandemic.

We selected issues that were already or going to be hard hit, invited experts to talk about them and opened the doors to our No Bullshit space. That’s our only rule: no bullshit, no sugar-coating, no saying one thing while meaning another, no generating confusion and doubt where clarity and helpful information are most needed. Absolutely no bullshit.

Five weeks and eleven online sessions later, we created some pretty good content for future generations to look back on (the internet never forgets) and remember these crazy, horrible days.

But the Pandemic isn’t our only tickled fancy. See, the beauty of Isto Vai is that you can add whatever you want after it. Isto Vai = This will. Now you just complete it with whatever makes your eyes light up: This will run smoothly, run into a wall, be fantastic, fail, result in a shit show of epic proportions… You get the idea.

We are a world of possibilities. We can happen at any time, anywhere, with anyone and about anything. Whatever does happen, we guarantee there’ll be no beating about the bush, no dumbing down and absolutely no bullshit anywhere in sight.
